# About Me
I'm Sabareesh Vigram Ravichandran, a front-end developer passionate about building interactive and user-friendly web applications. Currently, I'm enhancing my skills in back-end development to become a full-stack developer. I enjoy collaborating on open-source projects and am always eager to contribute to the community. Besides my love for tech, I have a deep interest in history and the Star Wars universe. Feel free to reach out to me at svigramr@outlook.com for any queries or collaboration ideas.
